Output -> 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  2  2  2 

Thoughts -> Considering the 0s to be between Index 0 to zeroIndex
			    1s to be between zeroIndex to oneIndex
			    Unknowns between oneIndex to twoIndex
			    2s to be between twoIndex to Last Index

As the we sort the unknowns should shrink, aligning 0s, 1s and 2s.
